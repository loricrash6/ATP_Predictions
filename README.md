# ATP_predictions
MALIS Project

The scripts of the Data_Creation folder output the "final.csv" file with historical data and odds for each ATP match in the decade 2010-2019 with enough past statistics (+"final_2020.csv" for the last year, processed separately).

The notebook "atp_predictions.ipynb" (+ "neural_network.py") was used to do some experiments, which did not end up with significantly positive results.

Therefore, as explained in the paper, the Big Tournaments + Big Players Approach was developed on Logistic Regression with "model_bets.py" (and "betting.py" from which betting simulations are made). Final results of this work are taken from here.
